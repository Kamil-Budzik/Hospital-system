# Hospital Management System

A modern, microservices-based hospital management system built with Go. This system helps hospitals manage patients, appointments, medical records, and billing through a set of interconnected services.

## Features

- üè• Complete hospital management solution
- üîê Secure authentication and authorization
- üë• Patient and doctor management
- üìÖ Appointment scheduling
- üìã Medical records management
- üí∞ Billing and invoicing
- üì® Notification system

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **User Service** (Port 8001): Handles user authentication and management
- **Patient Service** (Port 8002): Manages patient information
- **Appointment Service** (Port 8003): Handles scheduling and appointments
- **Medical Records Service** (Port 8004): Manages patient medical records
- **Billing Service** (Port 8005): Handles invoicing and payments
- **Notification Service** (Port 8006): Manages system notifications

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+
- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- Make

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-system.git
cd hospital-system
```

2. Install development tools:
```bash
make install-tools
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy example env files for each service
cp services/user-service/.env.example services/user-service/.env
cp services/patient-service/.env.example services/patient-service/.env
# ... repeat for other services
```

4. Start the services:

### Development mode (with hot reload):
```bash
make run-all
```

### Using Docker:
```bash
make docker-up
```

## Development

### Project Structure
```
hospital-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run-all.sh

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-service/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patient-service/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Available Make Commands

- `make run-all`: Start all services with hot reload
- `make build-all`: Build all services
- `make test-all`: Run tests for all services
- `make docker-up`: Start all services using Docker
- `make docker-down`: Stop all Docker services
- `make run-service service=user port=8001`: Run a specific service

### Adding a New Service

1. Create a new service:
```bash
make new-service  # Enter service name when prompted
```

2. Implement the service endpoints following the project structure
3. Add the service to `docker-compose.yml`
4. Update the `scripts/run-all.sh` file

## API Documentation

## Configuration

Each service has its own configuration file in `.env`:

```env
SERVER_PORT=8001
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=hospital
```

## Testing

Run tests for all services:
```bash
make test-all
```

Run tests for a specific service:
```bash
cd services/user-service
go test ./...
```
